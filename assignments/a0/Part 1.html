<h1>About me</h1>
<p> <h5>I am a CIS student and my goals this semester are to be introduced 
    to concepts of multimeda data. Concepts like,  
    compress and process the three main types of multimedia (Images, video, audio) 
    My experience programming started off with learning Cpp. 
    I learned my first basic programs in an IDE "Visual Studios". 
    As a MacOs user I branched out and started trying xcode for .cpp. I also 
    worked on a few iOS apps with swift and made some other (very basic) games 
    in Java and Cpp. Since then I have been intrested in working with git and 
    learning BASH. </h5></p>

<p><h5><b>HTML</b> is a <i>tricky beast</i> for me. I started off in programming
     c&#43;&#43; and never fundamently learned HTML. With that being said I did some self 
     teaching on <em>Code</em><strong>Acadamey</strong> and had exposture to it in CIS335. 
     I will do my best to d&Sigma;m&phi;nstrate what I know. </h5></a>
